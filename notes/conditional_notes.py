# AT 6th condtion notes

# 1 what puts something insdie of a if statment
    # a true or false statment
# 2 what do if statments do
    # they check true or flase statment
# 3 what do boolean statments do
    # something that is always either true or false
# 4 what do else statments do
    # basically take the if statement if its not true or false it will make it something else
# 5 what kind of statement do you use if you have more than 2 needed statements
    # when our code is tabbed over its in our if statement if not its not or you wanna check more than one thing
# 6 what do these symbols mean
    # < less than, greater than >, >= greater than or equal to, < less than or equal to
# use to equal signs to see if its equal so it doesnt think its a variable, you can check if its not equal to by a ! and = 
#7 what are the 3 logical operators
    # AND OR NOT
# 8 what are logical operators for?
    # it lets us put multiple conditions together so i can check two or more conditons at the same time
# 9 what does a nested condtional do
    # makes it so one line will always run no matter the above commands
# elif means else if
